### DIP Switch Layout Reference

#### Region Mapping

| Region            | JP6  | JP10 | JP12 |
|-------------------|------|------|------|
| Japan (JP)        | 1    | 0    | 0    |
| North America (NA)| 0    | 1    | 0    |
| Europe (EU)       | 0    | 1    | 1    |

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> Consoles with a **Region-Free BIOS** do not require DIP switch signal control, and may remain in their original state.  
> For the **original BIOS** or standard dumps, the PIC must control JP6, JP10, and JP12, and these lines must be properly connected.

The image below illustrates the typical layout of the region DIP switch pairs on Sega Saturn mainboards preconfigured to the Japan region, along with important modification points:

![DIP switch layout](img/dipswitch.png)

- **Yellow highlights** indicate the **common terminals** pairs that are used for region detection by the system.
- **Red highlights** mark **0Œ© resistors** or **permanent traces** that must be **removed or cut** to safely use the DIP signals with the PIC microcontroller.
- **Green line** represents the signal line connected to **JP6**
- **Purple line** represents the signal line connected to **JP10**
- **Blue line** represents the signal line connected to **JP12**

### Region Signal Connection via IC9 (315-5744)

All Saturn mainboard revisions include an IC labeled **315-5744** (IC9), which interfaces with the region DIP switches (JP6, JP10, JP12).  
This IC is located on the **top side** of the board and offers convenient access points for connecting the PIC to region signals, especially when some DIP switches are located on the **bottom side**, depending on the board revision.

The image below shows the relevant pins of IC9 used to access the region lines:

<img src="img/ic9_va-sg.jpg" alt="IC9 region signals" width="650">

- **Pin 5** (green): Region line connected to **JP6**
- **Pin 7** (purple): Region line connected to **JP10**
- **Pin 8** (blue): Region line connected to **JP12**

Examples:
- On **VA-SG boards**, all region DIP switches are on the bottom side, making IC9 the preferred connection point for all signals.
- On **VA-SD boards**, only **JP6** is on the bottom side, so **pin 5 of IC9** can be used for **RC0**, while **JP10** and **JP12** remain easily accessible from the top for **RC1** and **RC2**, respectively.  

> [!WARNING]
> Connecting to IC9 only affects signal routing.  
> The DIP switch pads must still be properly prepared. Any fixed connections to VCC or GND must be removed as described.

### Control Board Wiring (Button & LED)

Some connections must be routed to the **front control board**, where the RESET button and original green power LED are located.  
The reference picture below shows both sides of the board, one trace cut, and solder points:  

![Command board points](img/ctrlboard.jpg)

- **LED replacement:**  
  Remove the original green LED and use its **via (K)** to connect the common cathode terminal of your **RGB LED** (typically the larger leg).  
  Make sure the original **via (A)** on the control board is **properly isolated**, so it does not make contact with any terminal of the RGB LED.

- **RESET/Cycle button:**  
  On the **back side** of the board, cut the trace marked in red (see photo).  
  On the **front side**, solder the wire from **pin 13 (RA0)** of the PIC to the terminal labeled **RA0** (as shown in the photo). This allows RESET/Cycle functionality to be driven by the mod.

- **Console RESET signal:**  
  Solder the wire from **pin 11 (RA2)** of the PIC to the **11th pin of connector CN8**, at the position labeled **RA2** in the photo.  
  (Looking top-down, this is the **sixth pin** from right to left.)

Make sure trace cuts and wire routing follow the reference photo to avoid electrical conflicts or missed signals.

## Saturn Mainboard Considerations

All Saturn mainboard revisions include **fixed traces** connecting DIP switch pairs to either **GND** or **VCC**.  
The exact placement of these connections may vary depending on the **board revision** and **console region**, and they are typically implemented using **direct PCB traces** or **0Œ© resistors**.

These fixed links can exist on **either side** of a DIP switch pair and must be carefully **identified and removed** before connecting the corresponding signal to the **PIC**.

For example:
- A common case is **JP13** being permanently tied to GND when **JP12** is unused
- On some boards, **R29** replaces **JP2** as the GND-side of the frequency selector pair

Each DIP switch has a corresponding paired terminal:

- **JP6 ‚Üî JP7**
- **JP10 ‚Üî JP11**
- **JP12 ‚Üî JP13**
- **JP1 ‚Üî JP2** (or **R29**, depending on board revision)

> [!NOTE] 
> JP8‚ÄìJP9 also form a physical pair, but they are not involved in user-facing region settings and do not need to be touched.  

These pairs are wired such that:
- One side (e.g. JP6, JP10, JP12, JP1) typically routes to **VCC**
- The paired side (e.g. JP7, JP11, JP13, JP2/R29) routes to **GND**

These are implemented as matched pairs and must be carefully verified on each mainboard revision before use.

> [!CAUTION]
> Only one terminal of each pair should ever be active.
 
For example, if **JP6** is used to connect to VCC, then **JP7** (its pair) must remain **disconnected**.  
The same rule applies for all DIP switch pairs: **Both sides must never be active simultaneously**.

![DIP switch toggle](img/saturn-jumper-usjp.gif)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning

Before connecting any DIP switch signal to the PIC:

> [!WARNING]
> The common terminal of each DIP switch pair must be fully disconnected from any fixed VCC or GND source.  
> This ensures the PIC can safely drive the line HIGH or LOW as needed.  
> If the PIC drives a signal while the other side is hardwired, it will result in a **severe signal conflict** between logic levels.

- ‚úÖ Remove any **0Œ© resistors** or **traces** that may force a fixed logic level.
- ‚úÖ Ensure that **both sides of each DIP switch pair** are **not physically connected** to either **VCC or GND**.
- ‚úÖ Confirm with a **multimeter** that the common terminal is electrically isolated from power and ground.

> [!CAUTION]
> Failing to isolate the DIP signal lines properly can cause **permanent damage** to the Sega Saturn mainboard and/or the PIC MCU.  
> Always verify the electrical state of each DIP switch pair before enabling region or frequency control via DIP switches.

## BIOS Bankswitch Mapping

To support multiple BIOS variants, the system allows mapping specific images to each bank:

### Bank Map for 8Mbit (2 x 512KB banks)

| Region | Bank | A18 | 
|--------|------|-----| 
| JP    | 0    | LO  | 
| NA    | 1 üîÅ | HI  | 
| EU    | 1 üîÅ | HI  | 

### Bank Map for 16Mbit (4 x 512KB banks)

| Region   | Bank | A19 | A18 | 
|----------|------|-----|-----| 
| JP(1)    | 0    | LO  | LO  | 
| NA       | 1 üîÅ | LO  | HI  |
| JP(2)    | 2    | HI  | LO  | 
| EU       | 1 üîÅ | LO  | HI  | 
| JP(3)    | 3    | HI  | HI  | 

> üîÅ Same bank shared by NA / EU

### Supported BIOS examples:
These BIOS images are 512KB each and suitable for use in 8Mbit or 16Mbit chips divided into 512KB (4Mbit) banks:  

- **JP(1):** Sega Saturn (Sega)
- **JP(2):** V-Saturn (Victor)
- **JP(3):** Hi-Saturn (Hitachi)
- **NA/EU:** Sega Saturn - World-Wide (Sega)

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> The mod works with console‚Äôs **original BIOS** (IC7), a standard BIOS dump or a **Region-Free BIOS**.  
> When using the original BIOS or a standard dump, the PIC must drive the region lines (JP6, JP10, JP12), which should be properly routed to their corresponding pads on the mainboard.

> [!TIP]
> **Only Region-Free BIOS versions bypass the region lines requirement**.

## Preparing BIOS Images (Byte-Swapping and Merging)

1. **Endianness:**  
   BIOS binaries must be in **big-endian** format (byte-swapped).  
   This matches the 68000-based architecture of the Saturn.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Most BIOS dumps are in little-endian and must be byte-swapped before merging.

You can inspect BIOS byte order using a hex editor such as [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/hxd/), or through programmer software like **XGPro (XGecu Pro)** with the **T48 (TL866-3G)** EEPROM programmer, which provides an option for **byte-swapping**.

## Flashing BIOS to IC (Programmers and Adapters)  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Ensure the merged binary (e.g., `29F800.BIN`) is **byte-swapped** before flashing.

3. **Flashing:**  
   Use a **T48 (TL866-3G)** programmer with:

   - **ADP_S44-EX-1** SOP44 adapter for 29F800 and 29F1610  
   - **ADP_D42-EX-A** DIP42 adapter for 27C800 and 27C160
  
     ![Adapters](img/adapter.jpg)
   
   Or use any other programmer capable of writing to these ICs in their respective packages.

---

## BIOS Physical installation:  

> [!WARNING]
> The flash chips used in this mod (**29F800** and **29F1610**) use a **SOP44 package**, while the original Sega Saturn Mask ROM (IC7) comes in a **SOP40 package**.  
> Therefore, when installing the flash IC onto the board, correct alignment and pin handling is critical.

### BIOS IC7 alignment on the board (SOP44)

- Align pin **3** (A17) and **42** (A8) of the EEPROM to match the location of pins **1** (A17) and **40** (A8) of the original SOP40 Mask ROM (IC7).
- This places pins **1‚Äì2** and **43‚Äì44** of the flash IC **outside** the footprint of the original ROM and must be **lifted** (not soldered to the board).
- The original SOP40 Mask ROM must be **desoldered using a hot air rework station**. This tool is **essential** for safe removal without damaging the board.

  ![BIOS alignment](img/ic7.jpg)

### Wiring for lifted pins:

#### For **29F800**:
- Pin **1** (RY/BY#): **Not connected** or **VSS (GND)**
- Pin **2** (A18): Connect to **RA5 (Pin 2)** on the PIC
- Pin **43** (WE#): Connect to **VCC (+5V)**
- Pin **44** (RESET#): Connect to **VCC (+5V)**

#### For **29F1610**:
- Pin **1** (WE#): Connect to **VCC (+5V)**
- Pin **2** (A18): Connect to **RA5 (Pin 2)** on the PIC
- Pin **43** (A19): Connect to **RA4 (Pin 3)** on the PIC
- Pin **44** (WP#): Connect to **VSS (GND)**
---

> [!WARNING]
> In the VA0 revision of the Sega Saturn, the original Mask ROM (IC7) comes in a **DIP40 package**.  
> In this case, the replacement BIOS must use a compatible **DIP42 package**, such as the **27C800** (8Mbit) or **27C160** (16Mbit) UV EPROM.  
> Correct alignment and pin handling is critical.

### BIOS IC7 alignment on the board (DIP42)

- Align pin **2** (A17) and **41** (A8) of the EPROM to match the location of pins **1** (A17) and **40** (A8) of the original DIP40 Mask ROM (IC7).
- Although the board includes holes for DIP42, they serve different functions, and pins **1** and **42** of the EPROM **must be lifted**.
- The original DIP40 Mask ROM must be **removed using a desoldering station** (suction type). This tool is **highly recommended** to avoid pad damage.
- It's also a good idea to install a **DIP40 socket** after removal, to make testing and replacement easier.

### Wiring for lifted pins:

#### For **27C800**:
- Pin **1** (A18): Connect to **RA5 (Pin 2)** on the PIC
- Pin **42** (NC): **Not connected** 

#### For **27C160**:
- Pin **1** (A18): Connect to **RA5 (Pin 2)** on the PIC  
- Pin **42** (A19): Connect to **RA4 (Pin 3)** on the PIC

## Troubleshooting & Diagnostics

| Issue                                  | Details                                                                                                                                                   |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Mod not responding after installation** | **Possible causes:**<br>- No power supplied to the PIC (check VCC and GND on pins 1 and 14).<br>- Firmware not compiled correctly or flashed to wrong MCU. |
| **RESET button does not change region or frequency** | **Check for:**<br>- Press timing:<br>‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Short (<250‚ÄØms): RESET<br>‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Medium (<1250‚ÄØms): Frequency toggle<br>‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢ Long (>1250‚ÄØms): Region/BIOS cycle<br>- Ensure RESET lines are properly connected:<br>‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢**RA0** ‚Üî button input<br>‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚Ä¢**RA2** ‚Üî RESET output to console |
| **RGB LED not lighting up or wrong colors** | **Common causes:**<br>- Resistor values not optimized for LED brightness:<br> üî¥ Red = 220‚ÄØŒ©; üü¢ Green = 2‚ÄØkŒ©; üîµ Blue = 1.2‚ÄØkŒ©  *(for high-brightness LEDs)*<br>- For **diffused or lower-brightness LEDs**, use **lower resistor values** to improve visibility.<br>- Incorrect LED type: Must be **common cathode**. |
| **Image appears in black & white or stretched** | **Check for:**<br>- Medium press (<1250‚ÄØms) of RESET button toggles between 50Hz and 60Hz video modes.<br>- Verify that **RA1** (VF toggle output) is connected to the **common terminal of JP1** <br>- Ensure the JP1-JP2(or R29) pair is properly prepared. Both sides must be disconnected from fixed VCC or GND to allow signal control by the PIC. |
| **Console fails to boot or shows black screen** | **Possible reasons:**<br>- BIOS not byte-swapped to **big-endian** before merging/flashing.<br>- Flash chip misaligned: Verify correct pinout adaptation, especially for lifted pins (A18/A19, WE#, RESET#).<br>- Poor solder joints: Check that all flash pins are fully soldered and there are no bridges between adjacent pads.<br>- **A18** and **A19** lines not properly connected from the PIC to the corresponding BIOS pins. |
| **BIOS animation never changes when cycling** | **Check for:**<br>- Whether only one BIOS bank was flashed (other banks left blank or filled with the same image).<br>- If **A18** and **A19** lines are hardwired to VCC or GND. They must remain under PIC control. |

## ‚ùî FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary>Do I need to byte-swap the BIOS files?</summary>

*Yes. All BIOS images must be converted to **big-endian** format before merging or flashing.  
Most raw dumps found online are in **little-endian**, and must be byte-swapped to ensure compatibility with the Saturn‚Äôs 68000-based architecture.*
</details>


<details>
<summary>Can I use a single Region-Free BIOS image?</summary>

*Yes. Region-Free BIOS images work without PIC control over **JP6**, **JP10**, and **JP12**.  
If **all BIOS banks** contain Region-Free images, those jumper lines can be **left unconnected**, and region selection via long press will have no effect but BIOS switching will still work as expected.*
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to use all BIOS banks?</summary>

*No. The mod supports different usage modes:*
- ***Original BIOS (no switching):**  
  Define `#define BIOS IC_8M` and leave **A18** and **A19** unconnected.  
  In this mode, the mod cycles through 3 region presets (JP ‚Üí NA ‚Üí EU ‚Ü∫) using long RESET presses.  
  To enable this functionality, the region selection lines (JP6, JP10, JP12) must be properly wired to the PIC. If these lines are not connected, region cycling will have no effect.*
- ***2-bank mode (8Mbit flash):***  
  *Define `IC_8M` and connect **A18**.*  
  *The PIC will alternate between 2 BIOS banks across 3 regions presets.*
- ***4-bank mode (16Mbit flash):***  
  *Define `IC_16M` and connect both **A18** and **A19**.*  
  *This enables cycling through 5 presets (JP ‚Üí NA ‚Üí JAP2 ‚Üí EU ‚Üí JAP3 ‚Ü∫) with full multi-BIOS support.  
  The additional cycles are intended to accommodate BIOS variants specific to Japan-only models, such as V-Saturn and Hi-Saturn.  
  Use `IC_16M` only if all 4 banks are properly populated, otherwise, select `IC_8M` to avoid cycling into unused positions.*
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do region dipswitches have any effect with Region-Free BIOS?</summary>

*No. Region-Free BIOS images ignore the region lines (JP6, JP10, JP12) and always allow the console to boot **any game disc**, regardless of its region.  
You can still install multiple Region-Free BIOS variants (e.g. Sega, V-Saturn, Hi-Saturn) and switch between them with long RESET presses even if the region lines are not connected.*
</details>

<details>
<summary>What happens if I don't remove the factory region/frequency jumpers?</summary>

*If dipswitches (e.g. JP6, JP10, JP12, JP1‚ÄìJP2/R29) have their common terminals internally linked to fixed **VCC or GND**, connecting them to the PIC may result in **electrical conflict** when it attempts to drive those signals.*
This can lead to logic errors or even **permanent damage** to the PIC or Saturn mainboard.  
*However, **if you are not connecting the PIC to any of these lines** for instance:*
- *You're using only Region-Free BIOS (no need for region control), and/or*  
- *You‚Äôre not using the 50/60Hz toggle (no VF control)*

*Then the original dipswitches may remain intact with no risk.  
Always verify your wiring plan before modifying dipswitches pads.*
</details>

<details>
<summary>Do I need to configure JP1‚ÄìJP2/R29 for frequency switching?</summary>

*Only if you intend to use the **50Hz / 60Hz toggle** via medium button press.  
For accurate frequency switching and stable video output, installation of a **DFO (Dual Frequency Oscillator)** is recommended (not covered in this guide).  
If that feature isn‚Äôt needed, the console will always run at its **default fixed frequency**, and **no modification to JP1, JP2/R29 is required**. In this case, you can also leave the **VF line (RA1)** disconnected, and medium press will have no functional effect.*
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I use a different type of RGB LED?</summary>

*No. This mod supports only **common cathode RGB LEDs**.  
Addressable LEDs (like WS2812) or common anode types are not compatible without changing the firmware and hardware logic.*
</details>
